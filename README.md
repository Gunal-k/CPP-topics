# C++ Code Examples - Basics, Patterns, STL, DSA & Sorting

This repository contains a curated collection of C++ code examples on topics like **C++ basics**, **patterns**, **STL (Standard Template Library)**, **basic mathematics**, **data structures and algorithms (DSA)**, and **sorting**. These examples are designed to provide an in-depth understanding of core concepts and to help you sharpen your coding skills for interviews and competitive programming.

## üìÇ Topics Covered:

- **C++ Basics**  
  Introduction to C++ syntax, functions, classes, pointers, memory management, etc.

- **Patterns**  
  Code examples to print various patterns such as triangle, square, diamond, etc.

- **STL (Standard Template Library)**  
  Working with **vectors**, **maps**, **sets**, **queues**, **stacks**, and **iterators**.

- **Basic Math**  
  Algorithms for solving basic math problems, such as finding GCD, LCM, prime numbers, etc.

- **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**  
  Solutions to common problems related to arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.

- **Sorting Algorithms**  
  Implementation of various sorting techniques such as **Bubble Sort**, **Merge Sort**, **Quick Sort**, **Insertion Sort**, and more.
